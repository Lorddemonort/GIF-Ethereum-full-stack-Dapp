create "client" and "smart_contract" folders under root

npm create vite@latest

create "components" under "src" for Navbar, Footer, Loader, and website sections and index.js for routing export

install tailwind

install any dependencies/packages

build the front-end

cd client

npm init -y

npm install hardhat

npx hardhat, select "Javascript" and yes, yes

npm install --save-dev "hardhat@^2.19.0" "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox@^3.0.0" ethers chai
(make sure you install stable version of ethers and other packages, I installed npm i -S ethers@5.7.2 and some errors were gone)
(also, a new updated is that you only need to install hardhat and hardhat-toolbox, hardhat-toolbox contains all needed packages like chai, waffle, etc. for testing)

npm install --save-dev @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox

npx hardhat compile

npx hardhat test(this should test the default smart contract)

npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli


Deployment steps:

1) under client folder run "npm run build"

2)
